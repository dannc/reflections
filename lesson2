What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

- git creates its own status .git directory to identify itself as a git repo
- It is needed so that git can track changes and hold configuration regarding the repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value
do you think it offers?

- The working directory contains some set of files.  Some files may not ever be added to the repository
- The repository contains only those files in the working directory that have been commited to the repo.
- The staging area contains changes (adds, removes, updates) that are "in progress" but that haven't yet
been commited to the repo
- This allows you to make changes and then later decide to commit those changes to the repo when I
think I have a group of files that are ready for submission to the repo.
